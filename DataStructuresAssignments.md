## C-1 Dynamic Array Creation (30/01/24)
Based on the following points create your implementation for a library of Dynamic sized array for any type.
- Would have a **Fixed Type Value**
- **Indexed by signend integers,** base specified at time of creation
- To specify **Size of array at time of creation.**
- At time of storage if the bounds are to be increased towards the back allow it even after the maxCapacity is reached (Dynamic) (Advance: Implement the logic to also allow to be increased from the front --using arrays only)
- Implement the correct domain expansion and compaction logic
- Delete functionality delet by index
- Null is a type that can be stored 

> You are not allowed to use C++ Template library

## W-1 N-Dimensional Array storage order Analysis (30/01/24)
Based on the Analysis of 2D storage analysis done in class analyse the storage of a N-Dimensional array.

Write about what is an array 1D, 2D, and its abstract data type reprenstation, (mapping , define entity, define conversions int a row measure order)

Also solve the conversions for a upper triangular, lower triangular n X n array (n is size) .

## C-2 Implementing Stack (30/01/24)
Implement a stack of fixed size which is able to store any datatype and have the following generic operations
- push
- pop
- top
- isEmpty
- isFull

## C-3 Implementing Queque (30/01/24)
Implement a simple queue for fixed size which is able to store any datatype and have the following generic operations
- enqueue
- dequeue
- front
- isEmpty
- isFull

## C-4 Implement Polynomials (30/01/24)
Implement all operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division) for polynomials in mathematics using arrays.
